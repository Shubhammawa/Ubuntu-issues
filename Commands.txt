Getting a "grub>" prompt instead of the usual options to load different os

Following is a fix which worked for me-

grub> set pager=1

Type ls to list all partitions that GRUB sees

grub> ls
(hd0) (hd0,gpt8) (hd0,gpt7) (hd0,gpt6)....(hd0,gpt1)            // You will see something like this

If you see msdos instead of gpt it means that your system has the old-style MS-DOS partition table

Use the ls command to see what files are on your system. Omit the gpt or msdos labels and just use the number in the next commmand.

grub> ls (hd0,1)/

lost+found/ bin/ boot/ cdrom/ ... /lib64 / media/ root/ .....initrd.img init.img.old

If you find something like this written it means we have found the root filesystem. Use the above commands on different partition 
to see which partition is the root filesystem in your system.

You can read any file on the system using the cat command

grub> cat (hd0,1)/etc/issue
Ubuntu 14.04 LTS \n \l                  

Now:

grub> set root=(hd0,1)                            // Enter the partition number according to your system (root)
grub> linux /boot/vmlinuz-4.4.0-31-generic root=/dev/sdX
// Type until /boot/vmli and then press to TAB to complete the sentence
// In place of X you have to write the partition number 
// hd0,1  = sda1    hd0,2 = sda2    hd1,3 = sdb3    hd3,2 = sdd2  and so on

grub> initrd /boot/initrd.img-4.4.0-31-generic
grub> boot


After successfully booting your system, run these commands to fix GRUB permanently

sudo update-grub

sudo grub-install /dev/sda
